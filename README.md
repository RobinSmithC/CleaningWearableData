# CleaningWearableData
Getting and Cleaning Data Course Project

run_analysis.R takes data generated by a Samsung phone worn on the body of 30 subjects. The data is in two data sets (train and test) and each data set has 3 files. The data is merged into one data set. The data from the files are not labeled inside the file. The code in run_analysis labels the data using the data set provided. The final step is to make the data tidy in which one observation exists on one row. The tidy data set is exported and uploaded. The code run_analysis does not include the code to create the tidy output which was uploaded.
